Cryptography and Security System-Practical(Experiments)


## Exp 01 : Design and Implementation of a product cipher using Substitution and Transposition ciphers.           
## Exp 02 : Implementation and analysis of RSA cryptosystem and Digital signature scheme using RSA.  
## Exp 03: Implementation of Diffie Hellman Key exchange algorithm.
## Exp 05 : Exploring wireless security tools like Kismet, NetStumbler etc.   
## Exp 06 : Study the use of network reconnaissance tools like WHOIS, dig, traceroute, nslookup to gather information about networks and domain registrars.  
## Exp 07 : Study of packet sniffer tools wireshark :-
1. Observer performance in promiscuous as well as non-promiscuous mode. 
2. Show the packets can be traced based on different filters.
## Exp 08 : Download and install nmap. Use it with different options to scan open ports, perform OS fingerprinting, do a ping scan, tcp port scan, udp port scan, etc.
